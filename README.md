# weather-checker-app
 This project is a Weather Checker webpage that allows users to fetch and view real-time weather information for any location using the WeatherAPI service. The interface features a clean, responsive design with a gradient background and a centered weather card for better user experience. Users can enter the name of a city or location in the input field, and upon clicking the “Get Weather” button, the application sends a request to the WeatherAPI endpoint to retrieve current weather data along with the Air Quality Index (AQI). The retrieved information—such as the location name, temperature in Celsius, weather condition, and AQI—is displayed dynamically without reloading the page. The application also includes error handling to alert users if an invalid or empty location is entered, ensuring a smooth and interactive experience across both desktop and mobile devices.
